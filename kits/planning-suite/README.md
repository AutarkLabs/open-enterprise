# Planning Suite DAO Template

## What's a DAO Kit

[Aragon dao-kits](https://github.com/aragon/dao-kits)

This is a kit customized from [Aragon beta templates](https://github.com/aragon/dao-kits/blob/master/kits/beta-base/readme.md).

## Rinkeby-ready kit

Autark creates and certifies this kit. This comes without any guarantees, a kit we consider secure today may be vulnerable to an unknown security hole discovered down the road.

At the moment, the kit is deployed on rinkeby:

- [PlanningSuite](./contracts/PlanningKit.sol): `planning-suite.open.aragonpm.eth`

You can find more information about kit deployments and their addresses in the [deployments package](../../shared/deployments/README.md)

## Usage

```js
planningSuite.newInstance(
  name,
  symbol,
  holders,
  stakes,
  supportNeeded,
  minAcceptanceQuorum,
  candidateSupportPct,
  minParticipationPct,
  voteDuration
)
```

## Steps to publish and deploy

1. Deploy template contracts to the desired environment
2. Publish the template to APM
3. Create new dao with start-kit or reuse an existing one
4. Propagate and IPFS pin

```sh
npm run deploy:rinkeby
```
