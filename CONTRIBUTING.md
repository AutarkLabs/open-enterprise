ðŸ¦„ðŸš€Welcome to the space unicorn partyðŸš€ðŸ¦„

This is the project repo for [Aragon Nest proposal #24](https://github.com/aragon/nest/pull/24)

In order to get started contributing please find an issue marked "good first issue" and look over our rules for pull requests.

For details on getting your development environment setup please see our [README.md](https://github.com/Giveth/planning-app/blob/master/README.md)


## Pull Requests

In order for a pull request to get accepted it needs to:

1. Be in a branch that followings the naming convention [*issue id*]-[*issue description*] i.e. 1-contributing-instructions
2. Have a clearly documented solution that addresses the issue.
3. Have full test coverage for all new code (with some exceptions for front-end code)
4. Get reviewed by at least 1 core contributor (2 for first issues)
5. Pass all integration tests (code tests, and linting)

## Contributor Status and Compensation

All issues are assigned an hour estimate by our team during our twice weekly meetings using planning poker.

In order to get added as a contributor and get an invite to our meetings you need to accumulate at least 20 contributor points. For each hour in completed tasks a contributor gets 1 contributor point. This means if you complete tasks with weights 8 and 7 you could not attend meetings but after completing another with at least a weight of 5 you could!

Every month we allocate ~5,000 USD (ether fluctuates) to our RewardDAO, in order to be eligible all you need to do is complete a task with a given weight. At the end of the month we divide our RewardDAO budget evenly based on total points of contributions. Regular Reward members of the repository are not eligible for the RewardDAO so don't worry about us taking all those delicious points!

Currently payouts are handled manually using a multi-sig however in the future
